# Archmage-VR
∀Rchmage is a fast paced spellcasting wave survival game, that's easy to pick up, and hard to put down!

The game focuses on having a single button for all the player's actions, whether it be to make a fireball to attack or a stone wall to defend.

The player needs to cast spells correctly in order for them to work:
A ball of fire comes from the heart
A sword of water is unsheathed from the sweat on your back
A wall of stone grows from the earth beneath you
A soft wind turns to a powerful gust as it leaves your arms
All mages come equipped with bags of teleportation on their belts

The casting requirement of each ability changes where your hand(s) should be and where they should go. 
You're free to cast different abilities with each hand if you can handle it

This game was also shown at Science Rendezvous 2023 and 2024 as part of the VR demonstrations I lead for the event as a TA (Teacher's Assistant) for the Virtual Reality course at Toronto Metropolitan University
